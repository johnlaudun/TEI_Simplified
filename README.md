# TEI for ULTHATCamp

The contents of this GitHub repository were prepared for the THATCamp held at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2015. There are a number of example texts, most in TEI format, that show off the various possibilities for using it for either marking up texts or for capturing information about materials encoded in other media (e.g., audio or video materials). 

Please feel free to copy, download, or fork the repository, depending upon your knowledge and comfort with various technologies.
