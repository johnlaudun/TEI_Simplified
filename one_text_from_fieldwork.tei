He was in the excavating business, 
so he called me to come up and showed me the job. 
And we dug house basements. 
And that was when they were remodeling a lot filling stations, 
making them super service and that sort of thing, 
so I said, yeah, I’ll take it. 
So I worked there about two years and a half. 
And then we came back to Bloomington. 
At that time, my brother-in-law--
he’s passed away--
but at that time he owned a furniture store, United furniture.
