<l>I went to meet an old man in Marrero, </l>
<l>and he told me a story. </l>
<l>He went to look for a treasure with some other men. </l>
<l>And there was a controller </l>
<l>who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. </l>
<l>And when they arrived at the site, </l>
<l>they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, </l>
<l>and when he dismounted, </l>
<l>it was no longer a man on the horse. </l>
<l>It was a dog. </l>
<l>And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. </l>
<l>He said it was growling. </l>
<l>He said he knew the dog was touching him, </l>
<l>but he didn't feel anything. </l>
<l>It was like there was just a wind. </l>
<l>And he said they all took off running.</l> 
<l>He lost his hat and his glasses </l>
<l>and he tore all his clothes. </l>
<l>And even the controller ran off </l>
<l>and he never saw his Bible again after that.</l>
